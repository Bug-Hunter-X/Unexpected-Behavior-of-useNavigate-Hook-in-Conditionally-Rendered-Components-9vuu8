In React Router Dom v6, the `useNavigate` hook, when used within a component that's conditionally rendered, may cause unexpected behavior. If the component containing `useNavigate` is unmounted before the navigation occurs (e.g., due to a route change), a warning message might appear in the console, and the navigation might not happen correctly. This is because the internal state of the hook might be lost before it can complete the navigation process.
